This website is a personal space where I document my learning and practical experience in cybersecurity. It is primarily focused on **hands-on walkthroughs, investigations, and security-related writeups** derived from labs, simulations, and real-world inspired scenarios.

The content published here reflects my approach to understanding security events through hands-on practice. It is primarily based on walkthroughs of practical labs and simulated scenarios, such as those found on platforms like TryHackMe, where alerts, behaviors, and attack patterns are broken down and analyzed step by step.

Rather than focusing on high-level theory, the goal is to emphasize **practical analysis and reasoning**, documenting the investigative process, observations, and conclusions behind each walkthrough in a clear and structured way.

This site also serves as a long-term knowledge base. Writing and documenting each process helps reinforce concepts, track progress over time, and build a consistent methodology for approaching security problems.

All content is created for learning and educational purposes, with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and continuous improvement.
